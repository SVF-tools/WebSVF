# Deploy on Google Cloud

This tutorial shows you how to deploy `code-server` to a single node running on Google Cloud.

If you're just starting out, we recommend [installing code-server locally](../../self-hosted/index.md). It takes only a few minutes and lets you try out all of the features.

## Deploy to Google Cloud VM
> Pre-requisite: Please [set up Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/) on your local machine

- [Open your Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances) to create a new VM instance and click **Create Instance**
- Choose an appropriate machine type (we recommend 2 vCPU and 7.5 GB RAM, more depending on team size and number of repositories/languages enabled)
- Choose Ubuntu 16.04 LTS as your boot disk
- Expand the "Management, security, disks, networking, sole tenancy" section, go to the "Networking" tab, then under network tags add "code-server"
- Create your VM, and **take note** of its public IP address.
- Visit "VPC network" in the console and go to "Firewall rules". Create a new firewall rule called "http-8866". Under "Target tags" add "code-server", and under "Protocols and ports" tick "Specified protocols and ports" and "tcp". Beside "tcp", add "8866", then create the rule.
- Copy the link to download the latest Linux binary from our [releases page](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases)

---

## Final Steps

- SSH into your Google Cloud VM
```
gcloud compute ssh --zone [region] [instance name]
```

- Find the latest Linux release from this URL:
```
https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases/latest
```

- Replace {version} in the following command with the version found on the releases page and run it (or just copy the download URL from the releases page):
```
wget https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases/download/{version}/code-server-{version}-linux-x64.tar.gz
```

- Extract the downloaded tar.gz file with this command, for example:
```
tar -xvzf code-server-{version}-linux-x64.tar.gz
```

- Navigate to extracted directory with this command:
```
cd code-server-{version}-linux-x64
```

- Make the binary executable if you run into any errors regarding permission:
```
chmod +x code-server
```

> To ensure the connection between you and your server is encrypted view our guide on [securing your setup](../../security/ssl.md)

- Start the code-server
  ```
  ./code-server
  ```
- Open your browser and visit `https://$public_ip:8866/` (where `$public_ip` is your Compute Engine instance's public IP address). You will be greeted with a page similar to the following screenshot. Code-server is using a self-signed SSL certificate for easy setup. In Chrome/Chromium, click **"Advanced"** then click **"proceed anyway"**. In Firefox, click **Advanced**, then **Add Exception**, then finally **Confirm Security Exception**.<img src ="../../assets/chrome_warning.png">
