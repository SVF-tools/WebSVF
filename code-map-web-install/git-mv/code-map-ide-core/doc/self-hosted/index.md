# Getting Started

[code-server](https://coder.com) is used by developers at Azure, Google, Reddit, and more to give them access to VS Code in the browser.

## Quickstart Guide

> NOTE: If you get stuck or need help, [file an issue](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/issues/new?&title=Improve+self-hosted+quickstart+guide), [tweet (@coderhq)](https://twitter.com/coderhq) or [email](mailto:support@coder.com?subject=Self-hosted%20quickstart%20guide).

This document pertains to Coder specific implementations of VS Code. For documentation on how to use VS Code itself, please refer to the official [documentation for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)

It takes just a few minutes to get your own self-hosted server running. If you've got a machine running macOS, Windows, or Linux, you're ready to start the binary which listens on port `8866` by default.

1. Visit [the releases](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases) page and download the latest cli for your operating system
2. Double click the executable to run in the current directory
3. Copy the password that appears in the cli<img src="../assets/cli.png">
4. In your browser navigate to `localhost:8866`
5. Paste the password from the cli into the login window<img src="../assets/server-password-modal.png">
> NOTE: Be careful with your password as sharing it will grant those users access to your server's file system

### Things To Know
- When you visit the IP for your code-server instance, you will be greeted with a page similar to the following screenshot. Code-server is using a self-signed SSL certificate for easy setup. In Chrome/Chromium, click **"Advanced"** then click **"proceed anyway"**. In Firefox, click **Advanced**, then **Add Exception**, then finally **Confirm Security Exception**.<img src ="../../assets/chrome_warning.png">

## Usage
<pre class="pre-wrap"><code>code-server<span class="virtual-br"></span> --help</code></pre>

code-server can be ran with a number of arguments to customize your working directory, host, port, and SSL certificate.

```
Usage: code-server [options]

Run VS Code on a remote server.

Options:
  -V, --version               output the version number
  --cert <value>
  --cert-key <value>
  -e, --extensions-dir <dir>  Set the root path for extensions.
  -d --user-data-dir <dir>    Specifies the directory that user data is kept in, useful when running as root.
  --data-dir <value>          DEPRECATED: Use '--user-data-dir' instead. Customize where user-data is stored.
  -h, --host <value>          Customize the hostname. (default: "0.0.0.0")
  -o, --open                  Open in the browser on startup.
  -p, --port <number>         Port to bind on. (default: 8866)
  -N, --no-auth               Start without requiring authentication.
  -H, --allow-http            Allow http connections.
  -P, --password <value>      Specify a password for authentication.
  --disable-telemetry         Disables ALL telemetry.
  --help                      output usage information
  ```

  ### Data Directory
  Use `code-server -d (path/to/directory)` or `code-server --user-data-dir=(path/to/directory)`, excluding the parentheses to specify the root folder that VS Code will start in.

  ### Host
  By default, code-server will use `0.0.0.0` as its address. This can be changed by using `code-server -h` or `code-server --host=` followed by the address you want to use.
  > Example: `code-server -h 127.0.0.1`

  ### Open
  You can have the server automatically open the VS Code in your browser on startup by using the `code-server -o` or `code-server --open` flags

  ### Port
  By default, code-server will use `8866` as its port. This can be changed by using `code-server -p` or `code-server --port=` followed by the port you want to use.
  > Example: `code-server -p 9000`

  ### Telemetry
  Disable all telemetry with `code-server --disable-telemetry`.

  ### Cert and Cert Key
  To encrypt the traffic between the browser and server use `code-server --cert=` followed by the path to your `.cer` file. Additionally, you can use certificate keys with `code-server --cert-key` followed by the path to your `.key` file.
> Example (certificate and key): `code-server --cert /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.cer --cert-key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.key`
> Example (if you are using Letsencrypt or similar): `code-server --cert /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem --cert-key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.key`

> To ensure the connection between you and your server is encrypted view our guide on [securing your setup](../security/ssl.md)

  ### Nginx Reverse Proxy
  Nginx is for reverse proxy. Below is a virtual host example that works with code-server. Please also pass --allow-http. You can also use certbot by EFF to get a ssl certificates for free.
  ```
  server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name code.example.com code.example.org;
      location / {
         proxy_pass http://localhost:8866/;
         proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
         proxy_set_header Connection upgrade;
         proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding gzip;
      }
   }
  ```

  ### Apache Reverse Proxy
  Example of https virtualhost configuration for Apache as a reverse proxy. Please also pass --allow-http on code-server startup to allow the proxy to connect.
  ```
  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName code.example.com

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} =websocket [NC]
    RewriteRule /(.*)           ws://localhost:8866/$1 [P,L]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} !=websocket [NC]
    RewriteRule /(.*)           http://localhost:8866/$1 [P,L]

    ProxyRequests off

    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto https
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Port 443

    ProxyPass / http://localhost:8866/ nocanon
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8866/

  </VirtualHost>
  ```
  *Important:* For more details about Apache reverse proxy configuration checkout the [documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy.html) - especially the [Securing your Server](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy.html#access) section

  ### Help
  Use `code-server --help` to view the usage for the CLI. This is also shown at the beginning of this section.
